# Review and Feedback Microservice

## Overview
This microservice handles customer feedback and reviews for consumed entities. It allows customers to submit initial ratings and comments, as well as update their previously submitted feedback.

## Team Members
- Lev: Main implementation (API endpoints, business logic)
- Thomas: Initial setup + deployment/Docker configuration
- Olivia: Database schema design, UML diagrams, Testing

## User Stories

### 1. Submit Initial Feedback
**As a customer**, I want to submit my initial rating and written comment for a consumed entity so that I can officially record and share my experience with the system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Functional: Logged-in customers can submit feedback with User ID, Entity ID, 1-5 star rating, and comment
- Non-functional (Usability): API endpoint requires maximum of three core fields for feedback submission

### 2. Update Existing Feedback
**As a customer**, I want to edit the rating or comment of feedback I previously submitted so that I can update my feedback if my experience with the entity changes over time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Functional: Customers can update their own feedback with verification of User ID and modification timestamp
- Non-functional (Securability): Clear audit logs of all modifications including before/after states
